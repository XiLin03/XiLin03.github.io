* Received systematic training in fundamentals and principles of quadruped robots and reinforcement learning.
* Read over 10 relevant papers to determine a specific area of interest. 
* Built Isaac Gym reinforcement learning environments and imported the parameter model of the robotic arm to simulate training of robotic arm gripping and stacking cube tasks, adjusted parameters according to requirements, and completed related experiments. 
* Designed an academic poster.
